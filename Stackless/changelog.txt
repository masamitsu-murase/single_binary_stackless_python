Stackless-Python News
+++++++++++++++++++++

This file documents changes to the Stackless extension of C-Python.
For other changes see Misc/NEWS.


What's New in Stackless 3.X.X?
==============================

*Release date: 20XX-XX-XX*

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/77
  Fix a NULL pointer exception, if a call to stackless.tasklet() fails
  (i.e. called with invalid arguments).


What's New in Stackless 3.3.6?
==============================

*Release date: 2015-02-14*

- Windows installer: update openssl to version 1.0.1l.

- Windows installer: update tcl and tk to version 8.5.15.0 
  and tix to version 8.4.3.5. Python 2.7.9 uses the same versions.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/60
  Fix a crash

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/71
  Fix a regression in Lib/pickle.py. Pickling functions
  didn't work any longer.

- Fix for test_watchdog_on_tasklet_hard due to re !!!. The caching behaviour
  of re.py was changed in debug mode, which influenced the number of opcodes
  spent in our test.

- Fix compiler warnings found on MAC.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/61
  Fix a crash after unpickling hard switched tasklet. It is now
  always possible to inspect the local variables (frame.f_locals)
  of an unpickled frame object.


What's New in Stackless 3.3.5?
==============================

*Release date: 2014-03-11*

- Fix channel and tasklet initialization.  Initialization is now done
  using __init__ methods.
  Tasklet.__new__() now just binds the tasklet to the calling thread and
  ignores extra arguments.
  The tasklet.__init__() now works like tasklet.bind.
  Channel.__new__() now ignores extra arguments.
  These changes make subclassing taskelets and channels less confusing.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/commits/26a53cfeeeffeaacb55
  Make stackless.run() more flexible.  It can now be called by any tasklet.
  Without arguments, stackless.run() now nests, so that the innermost run()
  is awoken when the run-queue empties.  With timeout arguments, the first
  call to stackless.run() wins, so that it is possible to override
  watchdog behaviour on the outside of the app.  subsequent timeout calls
  to stackless.run() then behave as though they were called without
  arguments.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/commits/2c252b72ddaf628fb1
  Remove the "Flextype" internal type extension apparatus.  Tasklets
  and channels are now regular builtin objects.  C api functions like
  PyChannel_Send() no longer magically invoke python methods on subtypes.
  "stackless" module is now composed of builting "_stackless" and the
  regular "stackless.py" modules.  The latter of the two provides the
  "attribute-like" module access.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/commits/949c518c67c75a1
  Fix binary layout of PyTypeObject and PyHeapTypeObject for stackless,
  restoring binary compatibility with extensions built with regular
  Python.  In particular, extensions that themselves extend PyTypeObject,
  such as PySize and PyQT, now work with stackless.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/commits/b373fc28f004c
  Various fixes to deadlock detection and error porpagation.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/54
  Fix a crash


- Issue #50:
  Don't raise StopIteration in a deadlock situation.
  When a channel is closed, only raise StopIteration out of
  channel.__next__.  Send/receive raise ValueError.

- Issue #51:
  The tasklet attrubtes "is_main" and "is_current" now are computed
  relative to the tasklet's thread, not the calling thread.

- http://www.stackless.com/ticket/24: Enable unbinding of tasklets.
  The method tasklet.bind(None) now unbinds a tasklet.

- Add the stackless.atomic() context manager to enter an atomic state.

- Make manual inter-thread scheduling of tasklets more robust.  Fix
  various edge and corner cases pertaining to scheduling tasklets on
  a different thread.

- Reverse the "immediate" flag for tasklet.throw().  it is now
  tasklet.throw(..., pending=False).

- Don't silently ignore TaskletExit on the main tasklet.

- Diable pre-emptive switching in switch-trapped mode.

- When threads are killed, we try killing all their tasklets. They then
  become thread-unbound, so that the Python(r) thread state can be safely
  released. A tasklet without a thread reports its thread_id as -1.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/26:
  Add tasklet.bind_thread() method, to re-bind a soft-switchable
  tasklet to another thread.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/28:
  Enhance tasklet.bind() so that it can bind arguments as well without
  making the tasklet runnable.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/29:
  Add stackless.switch(), to do manual switching of tasklets without
  placing the source in the runnable queue.  I.e. the target is run and
  the source is paused.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/38
  Bug fix: An exception in the schedule callback caused an
  assertion failure in taskletobject.c, line 51

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/40
  Bug fix: If a thread state had an exception and tracing was enabled,
  the exception was not preserved on a soft switch.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/41
  Bug fix: Traced tasklet is unpicklable

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/42
  Bug fix: During the execution of the schedule callback the internal state
  of the interpreter was sometimes inconsistent. This caused tasklet related
  query methods and computed attributes to return incorrect results.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/43
  Enhancement: new attributes tasklet.trace_function and
  tasklet.profile_function

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/44
  Bug fix: some computed tasklet attributes (i.e. tasklet.alive)
  returned incorrect values when they were accessed from an thread the
  tasklet didn't belong to.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/45
  Enhancement: It is now possible to query installed schedule
  and channel callback functions.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/46
  Bug fix: invoking tasklet.run() on a tasklet from a already
  terminated thread no longer crashes the interpreter.

- https://bitbucket.org/stackless-dev/stackless/issue/52
  Use distinct product codes for the Stackless MSI installer.
  Increment the value of the product code of the regular CPython release
  by 8 if it is Stackless.


- Fix unlinking of tasks in kill_tasks_with_stacks. The earlier code
  was a bit weird and would cause miscompilation on X64.

- http://www.stackless.com/ticket/23: Fix compile error with STACKLESS_OFF
  defined

What's New in Stackless 2.7.4rc2?
=================================

*Release date: 2013-05-01*

(A selection of user visible changes from mercurial commit log messages. Use
 "hg log -b 2.7-slp -r v2.7.4rc2-slp:v2.7.2-slp  -v -M" to get the complete log.)

>>>>>>> other
- http://www.stackless.com/ticket/21: Fix crash on exit.

- http://www.stackless.com/ticket/22: soft switching for context managers.

- #17667: Fix Windows build using "build_pgo.bat -2".

- http://www.stackless.com/ticket/17: Fix a few clang warnings.

- http://www.stackless.com/ticket/14: Prevent overly optimization with
  gcc 4.7.x.

- Add the feature of a tasklet error handler, global to the module.

- Add the tasklet.throw() method, which can raise an exception on a tasklet
  with traceback, just like channel.send_throw.  It also has the facility to
  either activate the target immediately (default) or just make it runnable.

- Add the switch-trap flag. Add unittests for channel action and stackless.run
  and stackless.schedule.

- Fix tasklet.raise_exception.  It had invalid flags and didn't work.

- Fix default argument handling of channel.send_throw

- Add channel.send_throw(exc[,val[,tb]]) to raise a new exception or propagate
  an old one across a channel.

- Make sure that the tasklet's "atomic" flag inhibits thread switching, so that
  it can be used when synchronizing tasklets from different threads.

- Apply Anselm Kruis' patch to get amd64 linux building again without the 'bp'
  register problem.

- When a tasklet is killed, remove it from being "active" in the cstate.
  Otherwise, kill_task_with_cstatcks will spin endlessly trying to kill it.
  We have to fix kill_tasks_with_cstacks more properly later.

- Integrate changes to tasklet GC as run by CCP for over a year.  Tasklets are
  now properly garbage collected unless they have a C stack.

- Add a new api, PyStackless_GetCurrentId(), and stackless.getcurrentid(), to
  help with bookkeeping that has to do with callstacks.

- Fix errors where a PyCFrame could confuse code, both when pickling and when
  emitting warnings.  Now use proper internal Stackless methods to get at the
  frame.

- Remove tasklet become and capture methods/support. This functionality is
  considered in retrospect to be a mistake, and has been on track for removal
  for several years.  Goodbye cool functionality!

- A first draft of Stackless C API documentation. This has rewritten
  descriptions for most of the functions, but some still have the API include
  file comments.

- Committing Jeff Senn's non-Windows compilation changes as mailed to the
  Stackless mailing list
  (http://www.stackless.com/pipermail/stackless/2010-July/004766.html).

- the _lsprof.c module is now stackless aware.  This allows the same
  cProfile.Profile() instance to be used by multiple tasklets, for whole
  program profiling. A patch with this new _lsprof.c has also been submitted
  to bug.python.org. What remains now is the ability to set tracing/profiling
  for all tasklets globally.


Here is a break. Nobody wrote a change log. If you are interested
in software archaeology look at http://svn.python.org/view/stackless.


The very beginning of Stackless
===============================

20020524	ct	There appears to be a problem with stack switching
			and tkinter. When I disable it, things work. This is
			most probably a stack misuse with C locals used as
			globals. This gives a problem when squirreled away...
			Should we possibly disable stack manips completely
			by default and have the user switch it on?

20020524	ct	There have been massive changes in thee meantime, and
			I've missed logging them in the changelog.
			This will become better now.
			The old ideas of reusing old stackless stuff are gone.
			There is now always "hardware" switching of tasklets.
			Also, Limbo like channels have been introduced, which
			give us a very simple multitasking.

200203 to	ct	Thinking, thinking and reading. Alef, Limbo, Occam.
200205		Got hired by IronPort for working on Stackless and
			their application based upon it.

20020122	ct	There are some influences of olde Stackless. Without repeating
			the full mess, a number of ideas are very useful
			Especially, the frame dispatcher idea will be revived.
			It turns out to make sense:
			Try to let the innermost interpreter resolve some recusrions.

			Find an equivalent of old Py_UnwindToken. Probably the

			protocol of the new generators can be extended.
			Now I *do* think to modify frames. They get an additional
			field for their C stack part.
			There will definately be a revival of f_execute.
			This fits perfectly: For pure frames, this is eval_frame.
			For frames which need to restore their stack, it will be a helper
			function.
			I can see the light :-)

20020121	ct	Initial setup, first Stackless version (without functionality yet)
